### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ™‚ I'm kotlin-addicted (last times) programmer and I like do some funny new things. And I'm ready to collaborate for some fun things.

#### ðŸ¤“ Favorite languages:
 * PHP
 * Java
 * Kotlin
 * SQL
 
The most favorite is Kotlin - I think it as amazing thing to build clean-code beatiful-orginized projects.

#### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

##### :bullettrain_front:	Active:
 * [Kotlin telegram bot framework](https://github.com/asundukov/kotlin-telegram-framework)
 * [Meme generate bot](https://github.com/asundukov/meme-gen-bot) - production at https://t.me/MemeGeneBot
 * [Meme generate bot manager](https://github.com/asundukov/meme-gen-mange-bot) - pruduction at https://t.me/MemeBuilderBot


##### âš¡ Actually, I have some ideas/minds about what to do next, but these previous have too much issues to go next. Ok, I just leave it here
 * [Some test-build service, possible to move it as telegram-bot-based questionnaire](https://t.me/testfor.us)
 * Multiplayer web-based game where players control one dot and need to build some pictures together and win points
 * Multiplayer bot-based game with player-creatied content and often player-to-player interactions
